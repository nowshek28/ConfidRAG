Title: Troubleshooting Guide — Computer Vision Pipeline

Symptom: Blurry or out-of-focus images
   • Check lens focus and aperture; target f/4–f/8 for depth of field.
   • Verify exposure time; motion blur may occur above 5 ms at 60 fps.
   • Ensure the mount is rigid; vibration introduces micro-blur.

Symptom: Wrong colors or low contrast
   • Validate white balance and color-space conversions (RGB ↔ BGR).
   • Confirm flat-field correction files match the sensor and lighting.
   • Inspect gamma; set gamma to 1.0 for training data capture.

Symptom: GPU out-of-memory (OOM)
   • Reduce batch size or input resolution.
   • Use mixed precision (FP16) if model supports it.
   • Monitor with `nvidia-smi`; free up memory from other processes.

Symptom: Inference timeouts
   • Profile pre/post-processing; they often dominate latency.
   • Pin CPU threads and enable I/O prefetching.
   • Warm up models on service start to fill kernel caches.

Checklists
   • Camera: exposure, gain, trigger mode, cable, NIC bandwidth.
   • Lighting: flicker-free supply, sufficient lux, diffuser cleanliness.
   • Software: version pins, checksum of calibration files, config diffs.

Golden Rules
   1) Change one variable at a time.
   2) Keep a lab notebook of every change.
   3) Roll back quickly when metrics regress.
